#  Hospital Analytics - SQL Project

##  Overview
This project explores hospital encounter data from Massachusetts General Hospital to help uncover trends in patient behavior, cost, and service usage. The analysis supports strategic decisions by addressing stakeholder ad-hoc requests using SQL.

##  Files Included
- `ad-hoc-requests.pdf`: Business questions provided by stakeholders for analysis.
- `Sql_queries.sql`: SQL queries used to answer stakeholder requests and extract insights from the database.

##  Tools Used
- MySQL

##  What I Did
- Designed a relational data model by identifying key table relationships (e.g., encounters â†” procedures).
- Used CTEs, JOINs, Window Functions, and aggregation logic to solve real-world healthcare analytics problems.
- Focused on cost breakdowns, payer coverage, patient readmissions, and encounter trends.

##  Outcome
This analysis enabled data-driven decisions by surfacing insights such as readmission patterns, zero-coverage rates, and top procedures by cost or frequency.
